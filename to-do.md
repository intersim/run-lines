# To Do:
* pagination on the front end
* improve design/UI
* different voices (at least for men and women)
* somes tweaks needed for toggling between speaking and listening (see beginning of Romeo and Juliet, passage between Sampson and Gregory)
* refactor pausing/isSpeaking functionality; use speechSynthesisUtterance.pause?
