# To Do:
* highlight current line
* improve design/UI
* different voices (at least for men and women)
* turn on speaking for stage directions
* somes tweaks needed for toggling between speaking and listening (see beginning of Romeo and Juliet, passage between Sampson and Gregory)
* refactor `actions/index.js`
* pagination?
	* split plays into json files for each act... or maybe even scene?
