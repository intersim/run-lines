# To Do:
* fix bad data
* buttons in footer to go to prev/next scene
* use sessionStorage (or maybe local storage) to save user's spot
* use Web Audio API instead of Speech Recognition API for listening functionality?
* capitalize Macbeth
* refactor:
  * listening & speaking actions
  * create separate package with shakespeare play data

## Bad Data:
* A Comedy of Errors (which Antipholus not always specified?)
* Pericles: all wrong when changing acts; esp, fix line numbers in Act 2 Scene 4
